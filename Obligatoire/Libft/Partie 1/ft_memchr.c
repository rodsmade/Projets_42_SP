void	*ft_memchr(const void *s, int c, size_t n);
// The  memchr()  function scans the initial n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s for the first instance of c.
// Both c and the bytes of the memory area pointed to by s are interpreted as unsigned char.
// The memchr() and memrchr() functions return a pointer to the matching byte or NULL if the character does not occur in the given memory area.
